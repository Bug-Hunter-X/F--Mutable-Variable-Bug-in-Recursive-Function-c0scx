# F# Mutable Variable Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in F# code involving mutable variables within a recursive function. The code attempts to calculate the sum of integers from 1 to 10, but due to the way mutable variables are handled, it produces an incorrect result. The solution shows how to correctly implement the calculation while avoiding this type of error.
